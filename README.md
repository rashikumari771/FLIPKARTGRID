# Loyalty and Rewards Program using Fungible Tokens

Welcome to the Loyalty and Rewards Program project! This project aims to develop a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program for E-commerce platforms. The project leverages blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and user engagement in the rewards and loyalty ecosystem.

## Features

- Generate fungible tokens as loyalty points on the blockchain.
- Define tokenomics, including token value and issuance rules.
- Implement effective account settlement/reconciliation between Brands and E-commerce platforms.
- Earn loyalty points through user actions such as purchases, referrals, and social media interactions.
- Distribute earned tokens securely and transparently to customers' digital wallets.
- Partners and sellers can issue tokens to loyal customers.
- Redeem rewards using tokens with transparent, on-chain tracking.
- All token transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- User-friendly interface for managing loyalty points, viewing rewards, and tracking progress.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the project:

For version-0.0.0
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pratapavinesh/FLIPKARTGRID.git`
2. Navigate to `/version-0.0.0/loyalty-program-blockchain-server/`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start a local Hardhat Ethereum node: `npx hardhat node`
5. In another terminal, navigate to `/version-0.0.0/loyalty-program-blockchain-server/`
6. Deploy contracts to the local node: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
7. Navigate to `/version-0.0.0/loyalty-program-blockchain-client/`
8. Install client dependencies: `npm install`
9. Start the client interface: `npm start`

Now you can interact with the loyalty and rewards program on the Version 0.0.0 backend.


For version-0.0.1
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pratapavinesh/FLIPKARTGRID.git`
2. Navigate to `/version-0.0.1/backend/`
3. Install backend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start a local Hardhat Ethereum node: `npx hardhat node`
5. In another terminal, navigate to `/version-0.0.1/backend/`
6. Deploy contracts to the local node: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
7. Navigate to `/version-0.0.1/frontend/`
8. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
9. Start the frontend interface: `npm start`

Now you can interact with the enhanced UI and features of the Version 0.0.1 frontend.
